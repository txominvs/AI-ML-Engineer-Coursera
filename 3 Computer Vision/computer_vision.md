# Image
- Height = number of rows and Width = number of cols
- Each pixel 0 ... 255
- 3 color channels: 0=red, 1=green, 2=blue

# Pillow (image manipulation in python)

# OpenCV (more difficult)

> WATCH OUT!
> PIL color channels are RGB 0=red 1=green 2=blue
> OpenCV color channel are BGR 0=blue 1=green 2=red
